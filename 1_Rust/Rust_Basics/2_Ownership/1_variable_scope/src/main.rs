// This is similar to C and other programming languages

fn main() {
    // A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid
    let s = "hello";
    /* 
    -> The variable s refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is hardcoded into the text of our program
    -> The variable is valid from the point at which its declared until the end of the current scope
    */
}                       // the scope is over here, so the variable is not valid after this scope. In this case it is the main function.
